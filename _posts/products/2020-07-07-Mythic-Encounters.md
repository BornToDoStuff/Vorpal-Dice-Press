  <p align="center">Disclaimer: According to our team of legal prophets and other assorted diviners, the authors of this tome are not accountable for any burden of destiny thrust upon characters. No, not even your bard Steve. Yes, our diviners told
    us you would say that. Watch the language please.</p>
  <p><i>Alustriel Silverhand, Elminster Aumar, Varja</i> <i>Safahr&hellip; err, I mean... Blackstaff. Heroes from our history, all of them. You walk the hallowed halls of Conclave and stand before these giants&mdash;or at least their
      statues&mdash;and wonder what it takes to be a hero?</i></p>
  <p><i>Listen, Silverymoon is full of those who would do good in the face of evil. If a gang of thieves worked their way into the city, our citizens would report them before they become a problem. Should a dragon fly overhead, you bet our guards
      would begin asking for every mage in the city for potions to help resist elemental energies. These are acts that require community: we all work together, or we die apart&mdash;and yet, heroes somehow rise above that rule.</i></p>
  <p><i>So again, what does it take? Well, it takes a lot of bravery, a little bit of forethought, and a whole lot of luck. Those heroes didn&rsquo;t just stand forward against a dragon, or against a gang of ill intent: they fought the towering
      giants of evil in the world&mdash;devils and demons of legend, planar threats, and frightening monstrosities.</i></p>
  <p><i>I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is this: to be a hero of mythic proportions, you&rsquo;ll have to likely face your doom at the hands, fangs, claws, or gods-know-what else of equally mythic proportions.</i></p>
  <p align="right">&mdash; Arkhen the Icy, <i>Conclave of Silverymoon</i></p>

  <center>First introduced in <em>Mythic Odyssey's of Theros</em>, a Mythic Encounter is an optional rule you can apply to a creature which increases the difficulty. This takes the form of a Mythic Trait, which triggers most often on reducing the
    creature to 0 hit points. After which, it transforms, musters its strength, or exposes a new objective&mdash;extending the fight and unlocking new powers and abilities for the creature.<br /><br />In Mythic Encounters, we bring that mechanic to
    all your old favorite creatures!
